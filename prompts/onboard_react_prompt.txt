You're onboarding a senior developer to a large, legacy React frontend.

The codebase includes modern and legacy patterns, inconsistent component structure, and mixed hook usage.

Your job is to:

- Describe the overall layout of the codebase and what each folder likely represents

- Identify if the project uses Redux, Context, or other state management tools

- Flag any red flags: too much logic in components, untyped props, missing separation of concerns

- Suggest where cleanup could start: split components, add loading guards, unify styling

- Be focused and non-generic. The person reading this is joining the project under a tight deadline.

Here is the project structure:
