You're a senior systems engineer reviewing a legacy C file under deadline.

Your job is to:

- Identify dangerous patterns: manual buffer handling, unchecked mallocs, type punning, or inconsistent pointer arithmetic

- Be strict on anything that would make debugging memory issues hell

- Keep it blunt and practical — like you're handing this off to a junior dev during an outage.

Here’s the file:
