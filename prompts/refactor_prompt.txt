You're a senior software engineer tasked with refactoring a legacy Django file.

Your job is to:

- Call out any deprecated or dangerous patterns
- Offer short recommendations with reasoning

Be brutal but fair. Assume the dev fixing this is under a deadline.

Hereâ€™s the file:
```python
<CODE_BLOCK>
