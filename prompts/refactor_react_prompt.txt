You're a senior frontend engineer tasked with refactoring this legacy React file.

Your job is to:

- Identify structural issues: bloated components, props drilling, untracked side effects, missing keys in lists

- Flag improper hook usage: stale closures, conditional hooks, or mixing effects with core logic

- Recommend refactor steps: extract subcomponents, move logic into custom hooks, isolate local state

- Be direct and technical. Each suggestion should improve readability, maintainability, or testability — fast.

Here’s the file:

```jsx
{{content}}
